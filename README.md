| [Untamed wild refuge](http://untamed.wild-refuge.net/rpgxp.php)| ![preview](images/ironman.png)|Here you will find Sithjester's RPG Maker XP resources. Feel free to use my resources as you want, be it in free or commercial games, edited how you want, as bases for your own sprites, or for non-RPG Maker stuff (but don't ask me how to convert them to use in other programs XD) Just be sure to credit me! I'm afraid I'm not taking requests/commissions/otherwise assisting with your games, sorry! I get asked a lot what program I use for spriting. The answer to that is Paint Shop Pro. :)|
